Shell programmed in BaSH shell
## But fully, what is it?
OpCMD is shell programmed in BaSH shell that creates directory .opcmd at your home directory where it keeps some files to run OpCMD.<br>
OpCMD simulates operating system. In .opcmd directory it creates directories "commands", "modules" etc. that's like main drive of Linux.<br>
OpCMD also have new user system. You can create it using "usermake", rename it using "username", and change its password using "psswd".
## Customizable?
Yes, of course.<br>
See at .opcmd directory in your home directory after OpCMD setup, and look at it.<br>
Create new commands in BaSH in .opcmd/commands directory, change commands on start-up of OpCMD in .mobiler/.start-up file, change OpCMD shell in .mobiler/comamnds/sh file... and more!<br>
You can also look at it source code, and make your own updates locally (only avaiable on your PC).
